# ppg-resources (Photoplethysmography)

A curated collection of high-quality libraries, datasets, research papers, and other resources for Photoplethysmography (PPG) analysis, with a focus on embedded PPG solutions for edge devices. This repository is designed to be a comprehensive and well-organized guide for researchers and developers working in the field of PPG, particularly those building efficient, real-time applications on resource-constrained hardware.
